here i am compiling just a recap of my weekend
did some homework
watched my dallas cowboys get eliminated from the playoffs
watched the seahawks get manhandled
a seahawks defender tried to take our a falcon's eye
watched the patriots struggle to beat the texans
did more homework
studied
watched the steelers skim away with a victory by scoring 6 field goals
finish my homework
studied some more

now i am working in lowercase lettering so that i can break my habit of capitalizing
using this format to get into the habit of coding
it seems that everything from web design to programming a basic interpretor like python deals primarily in lowercase letters
it seems that many things are case sensitive and only certain things should be capitalized
it will be nicer to start working on nice, clean code
once i structure things out, perhaps i can start figuring out how to actually implement these things
